## todo:

1. upload data to database
2. go backend to serve data to react (api to serve data, logic to retrieve data)
3. react front end to display data

### issues to address:

1. db tracking


### future issues to address:

1. Be able to run script in background without entering URL
2. Host db somewhere so data doesn't get lost and is cross-platform
3. hosting and servers in general, if I want to make this an actual website
